# Elm GraphQL Workshop

## Set Up

1. `cd` into the top-level workshop repository, and then run:

```
npm install
```

2. Open `elm-graphql-workshop` the top-level workshop repository in your editor of choice.

3. Try running this command and opening `localhost:8000` to ensure that everything is working:

```
./run.sh ./src/hello
```

If you see a nice friendly message show up in your browser after running that command, then you're good to go!
